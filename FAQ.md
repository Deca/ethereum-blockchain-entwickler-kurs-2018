## MetaMask Private Mode
Soon comes Private Mode from MetaMask 
https://medium.com/metamask/introducing-privacy-mode-42549d4870fa

We're probably doing a video about this and then post it here.

## Geth Private Network
It's not directly related to this course, but if you start a private network with Geth and you want to start the miner then you also need to specify how many Miner-Threads you want:

   geth --datadir=./blockdata --rpc --mine --miner.threads=1 --miner.etherbase=0x54bA8e223De78
970061e9E9aa96E3BF3C6048fb8 --rpc
